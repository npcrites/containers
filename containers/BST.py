This file implements the Binary Search Tree data structure.
The functions in this file are considerably harder than the functions in the BinaryTree file.

class BST(BinaryTree):
    '''
    The BST is a superclass of BinaryTree.
    That means that the BST class "inherits" all of the methods from BinaryTree,
    and we don't have to reimplement them.

        '''
        FIXME:
        If xs is a list (i.e. xs is not None),
        then each element of xs needs to be inserted into the BST.

        super().__init__()

    def __repr__(self):
        '''
        Notice that in the BinaryTree class,
        we defined a __str__ function,
        but not a __repr__ function.
        Recall that the __repr__ function should return a string that can be used to recreate a valid instance of the class.
        Thus, if you create a variable using the command BST([1,2,3])
        it's __repr__ will return "BST([1,2,3])"

        For the BST, type(self).__name__ will be the string "BST",
        but for the AVLTree, this expression will be "AVLTree".
        Using this expression ensures that all subclasses of BST will have a correct implementation of __repr__,
        and that they won't have to reimplement it.

    def is_bst_satisfied(self):

        Whenever you implement a data structure,
        the first thing to do is to implement a function that checks whether
        the structure obeys all of its laws.
        This makes it possible to automatically test whether insert/delete functions
        are actually working.

        The current implementation has a bug:
        it only checks if the children of the current node are less than/greater than,
        rather than ensuring that all nodes to the left/right are less than/greater than.

        HINT:
        Use the _find_smallest and _find_largest functions to fix the bug.
        You should use the _ prefixed methods because those are static methods just like this one.
