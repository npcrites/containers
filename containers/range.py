def range(a, b=None, c=None):
    '''
    This function should behave exactly like the built-in range function.
    For example:
    >>> list(range(5))
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    >>> list(range(1, 5))
    [1, 2, 3, 4]
    >>> list(range(1, 5, 2))
    [1, 3]
    HINT:
    If you can figure out how to use the built-in
    range function (without modifying the test cases!),
    then feel free to do so.
    That's fairly difficult to do, however, and it's much easier to
    just implement this function normally using the yield syntax.
    NOTE:
    For efficiency reasons, Python's built-in range object
    is written in the C programming language rather than natively in python.
    You can find the source code online at
    https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/ee7b713fec71/Objects/rangeobject.c
    The link takes you to a file that is 1445 lines long,
    and all it does is implement this simple functionality.
    My easy to read Python implementation of this
    function is just 15 lines long.
    (And with some code golf I also wrote a less readable
    version that is only 4 lines.)
    It is very common for C programs to be 100x longer
    than their corresponding python programs.
    C code must manage lots of details about the computer
    manually that python code automates for you.
    Carefully written C code can be faster than the
    corresponding python code because it can remove
    some of the overhead of this automation process,
    but the resulting code is much longer and
    harder to read/write.
