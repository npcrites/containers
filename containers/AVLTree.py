'''
This file implements the AVL Tree data structure.
The functions in this file are considerably harder than the functions in the BinaryTree and BST files,
but there are fewer of them.

        The lecture videos provide a high-level overview of tree rotations,
        and the textbook provides full python code.
        The textbook's class hierarchy for their AVL tree code is fairly different from our class hierarchy,
        however, so you will have to adapt their code.

        and the textbook provides full python code.

        however, so you will have to adapt their code.

        HINT:
        It is okay to add @staticmethod helper functions for this code.
        The code should look very similar to the code for your insert function for the BST,
        but it will also call the left and right rebalancing functions.
        '''

    @staticmethod
    def _rebalance(node):
        '''
        There are no test cases for the rebalance function,
        so you do not technically have to implement it.
        But both the insert function needs the rebalancing code,
        so I recommend including that code here.
